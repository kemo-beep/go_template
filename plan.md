4. **Configure**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure
5. **Run**: `make dev` (starts development environment)
6. **Test**: `make test` (runs test suite)
7. **Deploy**: `make deploy` (deploys to production)

## üìù Notes

- Each phase should be completed and tested before moving to the next
- Regular code reviews and testing at each milestone
- Documentation should be updated as features are implemented
